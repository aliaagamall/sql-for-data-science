# Data Cleaning with SQL

This folder contains resources for learning how to clean and preprocess data using SQL, specifically with SQL Server. It includes practical examples to handle issues like NULLs, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

## Files
- **`data_cleaning.sql`**: A comprehensive SQL script that creates a sample dataset, cleans it step-by-step (e.g., removing duplicates, fixing data types), and sets up a primary key. Run this in SQL Server to see the process in action.
- **`data_cleaning.md`**: A markdown file with the same cleaning steps, including explanations and sample outputs, ideal for reading or sharing as a tutorial.

## How to Use
1. Open `data_cleaning.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a similar tool.
2. Execute the script to create the `CustomerInfo` table, insert data, and apply cleaning steps.
3. Review `data_cleaning.md` for a detailed walkthrough with outputs to understand each step.

## Purpose
These files are designed for learners and data enthusiasts to practice SQL data cleaning techniques on a sample dataset with common issues.
