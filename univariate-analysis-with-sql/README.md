# Univariate Analysis with SQL

This folder contains resources and scripts for performing univariate analysis on the `customer_data` table using SQL. Univariate analysis helps explore the distribution and characteristics of individual variables, providing insights into the dataset.

## Files

- **univariate-analysis.md**: A comprehensive guide explaining how to perform univariate analysis with SQL, including step-by-step queries, explanations, and beautifully formatted output tables.
- **SQLQuery.sql**: SQL scripts to create the table, insert data, and execute the analysis, organized with comments and expected outputs.
- **univariate-analysis-report.md**: To learn how to simply make report from insights you get from analysis performed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliaagamall/sql-for-data-science.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd sql-for-data-science/univariate-analysis-with-sql
   ```
3. Review the `univariate-analysis.md` for detailed instructions and run the `SQLQuery.sql` script in your SQL environment to replicate the analysis.

## Purpose

This section extends the `sql-for-data-science` repository by focusing on univariate analysis techniques, complementing the data cleaning efforts with deeper exploratory data analysis. It serves as an educational resource for learning SQL in data science contexts.
